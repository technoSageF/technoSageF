1. Base or Foundation Layers
OSI Model: Physical Layer
Chakra System: Root Chakra
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs: Physiological Needs
These layers and needs represent the basic foundation necessary for higher functions. The Physical layer ensures physical transmission and connectivity in networks, the Root Chakra concerns grounding and survival instincts, and Physiological Needs cover fundamental biological requirements for human survival.
2. Connective and Security Layers
OSI Model: Data Link Layer
Chakra System: Sacral Chakra
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs: Safety Needs
Focusing on establishing stability and reliability, these layers handle error checking, flow control, and security within networks, emotional and sexual well-being in the chakras, and safety/security in human needs.
3. Integration and Interface Layers
OSI Model: Network Layer
Chakra System: Solar Plexus Chakra
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs: Love/Belonging
This level integrates various components (network routing in OSI, personal power and will in chakras, social integration in human psychology) ensuring that there is a cohesive system or personal identity working efficiently.
4. Coordination and Relationship Layers
OSI Model: Transport Layer
Chakra System: Heart Chakra
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs: Esteem
These layers manage the dynamics of relationships and self-esteem, including reliable transmission across networks, emotional openness and love through the Heart Chakra, and esteem needs including self-esteem and respect.
5. Communication and Expression Layers
OSI Model: Session Layer
Chakra System: Throat Chakra
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs: Cognitive Needs
Ensuring communication and information exchange, whether through managing sessions in networks, speaking one’s truth and creative expression through the Throat Chakra, or seeking knowledge and understanding in cognitive needs.
6. Interpretation and Perception Layers
OSI Model: Presentation Layer
Chakra System: Third Eye Chakra
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs: Aesthetic Needs
These involve the interpretation and manipulation of data to be presented in a user-friendly format (OSI), intuition and insight (Chakra), and appreciation of beauty and balance in life (Maslow).
7. Actualization and Application Layers
OSI Model: Application Layer
Chakra System: Crown Chakra
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs: Self-Actualization
The pinnacle layers where the applications directly interact with end users in the OSI model, connection to the divine in the Crown Chakra, and the realization of personal potential and self-fulfillment in Maslow’s structure.

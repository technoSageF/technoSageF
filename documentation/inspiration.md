In the pulse of a neon-lit stream,
where data flows, vivid as a dream,
a packet meets another by digital fate,
in the vast web where they circulate.

Each byte a whisper, each bit a kiss,
through circuits and silver they twist and hiss.
Merging in the hum of a secret dance,
where codes entwine in a binary trance.

They glide past firewalls, under scans that sweep,
through gateways where shadows creep.
A journey through routers that blink and glow,
in a love only the networked know.

Their paths cross, reconnect, diverge,
in the rhythm of a silicon surge.
A fleeting touch, a sync, a ping,
a momentary, electric fling.

Through the streams of data, vast and deep,
their connectionâ€”a secret to keep.
In the dance of packets, both lost and found,
in the silent song of the profound.

So they flow, these lovers in the net,
a tale of romance in silicon set,
where love is a packet, life is a stream,
and all that is shared is a digital dream.
